## Day 2 
1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
Supervised learning involves learning to differentiate between existing categorizations or "correct answers." Conversely, unsupervised learning involves finding previously unnoticed patterns within data. 

2. Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
Scikit-Learn is used exclusively for data analysis and machine learning. Without another visual package, its results cannot be displayed visually.

## Day 3
1. What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning?
In terms of mathematics, tensors are multi-dimensional algebraic objects. They are used similarly in machine learning.

2. What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?
They all relied on an old version of tensorflow, so a lot of the code examples didn't run on my own system.


## Day 4 
I found this really interesting and fun dataset on the Ramen reviews: https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/ramen-ratings

What makes the best ramen? This dataset is quite simple, so perhaps a Feed-forward neural networks might suffice. However, I would aim to use a convolutional neural network to gain better insights with such a large amount of data.


## Day 5 
Project was to do the Kaggle Project on detecting sarcasm.

I felt quite while attempting this project - our previous assignments regarding neural networks had been purely theoretical, and jumping straight into practical applications felt like a weird stretch. I wasn't really familiar with a lot of the necessary packages at all, much less how to implement them. Thus, I mostly ended up copying others' code while trying to figure out how it worked.


## Day 8 
Today's task was to follow a tutorial for a convolutional neural network. I felt a little better going into this time with a bit more experience, and the readings also helped a bit more with helping me understand confusion matrices and such.

## Day 9 
1. How do you think Machine Learning or AI concepts were utilized in the design of this game?
We were first asked to make our own hiring decisions, with increasing time pressure. Using that data and data from other sources, a machine learning algorithm was then constructed to automate my decisions. This simulates how real-life ML models are built with data from previous hiring decisions.

2. Can you give a real-world example of a biased machine learning model, and share your ideas on how you make this model more fair, inclusive, and equitable? Please reflect on why you selected this specific biased model.
As outlined in the presentation, some models tend to allow certain traits to be labeled as a default and others as modifiers upon the default. This might seem quite harmless when applied to bananas, where the default is yellow and green could be a modifier. However, when presented with the label of doctor, it can be quite detrimental if male is labeled as the default and female is a modifier.

## Day 11 
Uploaded MNIST_Digits.ipynb code for analyzing written digits

## Day 12 
Uploaded ImageClassification.ipynb for classifying cats and dogs.

## Day 16 
One great thing about ReLu is that it is capable of outputting a zero value, unlike a lot of other activation functions. According to the reading, this is called "sparse representation" and is a desirable trait in a model as it can improve efficiency and learning.

Overall, I found today's reading to be quite approachable and easy to understand.

## Day 22
I found this week's reading to be really interesting as there can be a lot of cool applications with natural language processing. Ethically, there can be some concerns with models learning offensive or incorrect content from human writing that it is trained on.
